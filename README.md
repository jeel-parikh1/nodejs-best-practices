# NodeJs-Best-Practices

## Introduction
NodeJs-Best-Practices is a boilerplate for building Node.js applications with basic user CRUD and login/logout functionality. It uses the Express framework and MongoDB for database storage.

## Git Best Practices

### Commit Standards

- **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should represent a single logical change. Avoid combining unrelated changes in a single commit.
  
- **Meaningful Commit Messages**: Write clear and concise commit messages that describe the purpose of the change. Follow the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").

- **Commit Types**: Commit type must be following one:
   - feat: A new feature
   - fix: A bug fix
   - style: Changes that doesn't affect meaning of code(semi-colon, indentation, etc)
   - perf: Improve performance
   - refactor: Refactor code
   - test: Add missing test cases
   - docs: Documentation only change
   - chore: Change in auxiliary tools like documentation or seed change

- **Reference Issues**: If your commit is related to a specific issue or task, reference it in the commit message. For example, `fix: #123` or `feat: #456`. Here **#123** or **#456** are ticket Id.


### Branch Name Standards

- **Use Hyphens for Branch Names**: Use hyphens to separate words in branch names. For example, use `feature-branch` instead of `feature_branch` or `featureBranch`.

- **Prefix Branch Names**: Prefix branch names with a category or type. For example:
  - `feature/` for feature branches
  - `fix/` for fix branches

## Prerequisites

## Installation

   npm install
   ```
2. **Create Environment File:** </br>
   Create a .env file in the root directory of project and set the required environment variables. Refer to the provided .env.local for reference.

3. **Import Postman Collection:** </br>
- Find the Postman collection in the "postman collection doc" folder.
- Import Postman collection JSON file from postman
